In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

Also the higher the lstat (the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\") is the smaller or even a fixed price in house will be. Finally, based on the PTRatio, maybe a neighborhood with high ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools shows that there are many students in that area and the type of houses there are for primarily for families, thus bigger houses and more expensive, so the higher the PTRATIO the higher the house's price will eventually be."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "- I believe the second graph, the one in the right corner with max_depth = 3 is the one I prefer the most, because the model with max_depth = 3 does not overfit to the trainSet, due to the fact that after a number of Training points the model with the trainSet does not improve, so having a maximum depth equals to 3 is suitable for the model. Also both train and test curves are really close to each other showing that having max_depth  = 3 and a specific number of training points is representable for the model and the dataset. Moreover both the R^2 scores for the train and test Set are really good, they are almost close to 0.8 thus the model trained with max_depth = 3 predicts really well the price value from Boston houses. Furthermore the slope from the train and test set starting to be fixed after a number of training points, approximately 300 of them. To answer the third bullet I think that adding more training points than 300 to 350 will not benefit the procedure and to answer the second bullet having more training points will not benefit to the training and testing curve because after some points (300 - 350 of them) both lines are becoming like a straight fixed line."

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

Grid search allows to select the best possible model for prediction by allowing us to specify which of those parameters we want to change, their corresponding rangues and the function score to be optimised. It then gives us a combination of values for those parameters that optimize the scoring function by searching each of those models iteratively.\n",

    "\n",
    "In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal size subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

Based on this the second price prediction has a home with only 4 rooms leading to a lower price. I guess the 32% Neighborhood poverty level leads to a lower price compared to the first house prediction. The first client given the features with 5 rooms, 17% neighborhood poverty and 15:1 student to teachers ratio, the house price prediction is `$`406,933.33. In general the more Neighborhood poverty level the lower the house predicted price will eventually.
